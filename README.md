### Super Vised Learning vs Un - Super Vised Learning

**Supervised Learning:**

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where the algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or classify new instances. It uses input features and corresponding target labels to build a model that can generalize patterns and make accurate predictions.
**Example: ** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN ..
**Unsupervised Learning:**

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data to discover patterns and structures. It doesn't use target labels and focuses on finding relationships or grouping similar instances in the data.

### Bias and Variance in machine learnnig ( Machine Learnnig Trade off )

**Bias: **
The inability of a machine learning model to fit the data perfectly is known as bias.
  
**Variance: **

## LEARN NUMPY:
- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
